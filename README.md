### Application startup

1. Check main file
   - Make sure you have a main class annotated with @SpringBootApplication. This class serves as the entry point for the application.
     
2. Compile and Package the Application
   - In your terminal, navigate to the root directory of the project and run: mvn clean install

3. Running the Application
   - Runs the application from the spring boot dashboard extension

4. Verify Correct Startup
   - Once the application is running, you should see log messages in the console indicating that the embedded web server (such as Tomcat) has started successfully, and the application is listening on a port (by default, port 8080).
